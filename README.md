# Team_Profile_Generator

## Description

I've created a way for any  manager to list our their employees as a new or existing team to keep track of. I was able to do this using node.js. I created classes that were for each respective role; Manager, Engineer, as well as Interns. These cards were then created and placed into html cards to then be displayed for the manager to view. I included test files to see if my code was working properly.

## Installation

You will need to run an npm i 'inquirer' as I used the dependencies. Then start up the node app.js to run the application for your role as manager and any other team members you would like to add.

## Usage

Managers would use this to keep track of their employees names, emails, employee id's, as well as office numbers for their locations. I included extra options for interns with which school they attended and for engineers their github repo will be listed.

## Credits

I was able to work with some of my fellow classmates on this for a lot of my classes, tests and debugging. I went back to our class activities and some googling for the rest, which helped me with debugging as well. I used bootstrap for the card design and layout. Furthermore I used Lorem Picsum for the pictures that are generated in the cards.
